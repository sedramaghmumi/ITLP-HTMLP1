    <h1>what is a software</h1>
    <p>Computer software, or simply software,
         is a collection of data or computer instructions 
         that tell the compute r how to work.
          This is in contrast to physical hardware,
           from which the system is built and actually
            performs the work . In computer science and software
             engineering, computer software is all information
              processed by computer systems, programs and data.
               Computer software includes computer programs, 
               libraries and related non-executable data, 
        such as online documentation or digital media</p>
        <h1>Types of software </h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Application software </li>
            <li>System software </li>
            <li>Malicious software</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Operating systems</h1>
        <p>which are essential collections of software that
             manage resources and provides common services for
              other software that runs "on top" of them. Supervisory 
              programs, boot loaders, shells and window systems are
               core parts of operating systems. In practice, 
               an operating system comes bundled with additional 
               software (including application software) so that a 
               user can potentially do some work
             with a computer that only has one operating system</p>
             <h1>Device drivers</h1>
             <p>which operate or control a particular type of device that
                 is attached to a computer. 
                 Each device needs at least one corresponding device
                  driver; because a computer typically has at minimum at
                   least one input device and at least one output device,
                 a computer typically needs more than one device driver.</p>
<h1>Utilities </h1>
<p>which are computer programs designed to assist users 
    in the maintenance and care of their computers.</p>
