        <h1>The top 4 technology trends predicted to reach adoption in 2019 are:</h1>
   <h3> Deep learning accelerators</h3> 
    <p>such as GPUs, FPGAs,
         and more recently TPUs. More companies have been announcing plans to
          design their own accelerators, which are widely used in data centers. There is also an opportunity 
          to deploy them at the edge, initially for inference and for limited training over time. This also
           includes accelerators for very low power devices. The development of these technologies will allow machine learning 
        (or smart devices) to be used in many IoT devices and appliances
    </p>   
    <h3>Assisted transportation</h3>
    <p>While the vision of fully autonomous, self-driving vehicles might still be a few years away,
         increasingly automated assistance is taking place in both
          personal and municipal (dedicated) vehicles.
           Assisted transportation is already very useful in 
           terms of wide recognition and is paving the way for 
           fully autonomous vehicles.
         This technology is highly dependent on deep learning 
         accelerators (see #1) for video recognition.</p>
         <h3>The Internet of Bodies (IoB)</h3>
         <p>
            IoT and self-monitoring technologies are moving closer to
             and even inside the human body. Consumers are comfortable
              with self-tracking using external devices
               (such as fitness trackers and smart glasses) and with 
               playing games using augmented reality devices.
                Digital pills are entering mainstream medicine,
                 and body-attached, implantable, and embedded IoB 
                 devices are also beginning to interact with sensors
                  in the environment. These devices yield richer data
                   that enable more interesting and useful 
                   applications, but also raise
             concerns about security, privacy, physical harm,and abuse.
         </p>
         <h3>Social credit algorithms.</h3>
         <p>These algorithms use facial recognition and other advanced biometrics to 
            identify a person and retrieve data about that person 
            from social media and other digital profiles for the
             purpose of approval or denial of access to consumer
              products or social services. In our increasingly
               networked world, the combination of biometrics 
               and blended social data streams can turn a brief
                observation into a judgment of whether a person
                 is a good or bad risk or worthy of public social 
                 sanction. Some countries are reportedly already 
                 using social credit algorithms to assess loyalty to 
                 the state.</p>
