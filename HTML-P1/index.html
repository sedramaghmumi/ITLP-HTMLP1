A computer is an electronic device that
 manipulates information, or data. It has the ability 
 to store, retrieve, and process data. You may already
  know that you can use a computer to type documents,
   send email, play games, and browse the Web. 
   You can also use it to edit or create spreadsheets,
    presentations, and even videos

            <p >
            When most people hear the word computer,
             they think of a <b > personal computer </b> 
             such as a <b > desktop </b> or <b > laptop </b>.
              However, computers come in many shapes and sizes
              , and they perform many different functions in our daily lives.

            <p >
            Many people use desktop computers at work, home, 
            and school. Desktop computers are designed to be 
            placed on a desk, and they're typically made up
             of a few different parts, including the computer
              case, monitor, keyboard, and mouse

            The second type of computer you may be familiar 
            with is a laptop computer,
             commonly called a laptop. Laptops are 
             battery-powered computers that are more portable 
             than desktops, allowing you to use them almost 
             anywhere.

                Tablet computers—or tablets—are handheld computers that are
                 even more portable than laptops. Instead of a keyboard and mouse, 
                 tablets use a touch-sensitive screen for typing and navigation.
                 The iPad is an example of a tablet.

                A server is a computer that serves up information to other computers on a network.
                 For example, whenever you use the Internet, 
                 you're looking at something that's stored on a server.
                 Many businesses also use local file servers to store and share files internally.
